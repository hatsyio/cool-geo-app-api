<br>

Let’s say you are the lead backend developer of an exciting new project and your first task is to kick off the project structure and develop few endpoints to support frontend development.

You are given:

* An image representing the wireframe to implement (https://bit.ly/2S2AB9L)
* Two datasets, `postal_codes.csv` and `paystats.csv`.
    * ``postal_codes.csv`` contains Madrid’s postal codes with their respective WKB geometry.
    * ``paystats.csv`` contains credit card payment stats for Madrid postal codes.

        Each row contains the _total paid amount_ by an specific _age_ and _gender_ population group happened in a certain _postal code_ in a certain _month_.

Your goals are:

* Make a fully runnable stub project which documents all necessary routes the frontend developer would need in order to develop the attached wireframe. For now, it is not necessary to fully implement them, just to define them.

    At first, your source code may look as follows:

```python

@route.get('/entity1/')
def get_feature_1():
    """
    Serves data for wireframe's widget at position X.
    """
    # TODO: not implemented, stub
    return {
        my_data: [1,2,3],

    }

@route.get('/entity2/resource1')
def get_feature_2():
    """
    Serves data for wireframe's widget at position X.
    """
    # TODO: not implemented, stub
    return {
        my_data: [1,2,3],

    }
# ...
```
* Out of the previously defined route stubs, fully implement at least a 2 of them, including code for parameter parsing, DB connection, data serialization, etc. Try to show off :) .

* Design an architectural recipe as automated, scalable and reusable as possible to run an instance of the API as a whole infrastructure. It would be ideal to be able to run the api with a simple single command.

* Include a brief README.md file describing your app, your technical decisions and considerations, potential improvements, etc.

If you have some spare time and want some *extra points*, you can try to:

* Add some sort of authorization or login system to your app.

* Add some sort of caching system to your project.

* Create and endpoint that serves the Comunidad de Madrid’s geometry as an union of all Madrid’s postal codes, including aggregated paystat data for the whole geometry as properties.

You are restrained to commit to the following constraints:

* You can use any web development framework (Flask, FastApi, express, KOA, RoR, etc.), preferibly but not limited to Python, NodeJS or Ruby development languanges.

* Do not use an ORM layer or library. We want to clearly see how you understand, structure and exploit data. You may low level query builder tools, but your code must state clearly that you are the one making the decisions.

* We think this test should take you around 5~6 hours, but don't worry if you need more time or you're faster than us. We'd like you to send us your app in the next 7 days.

* You will get as much help, either technical or logistic as we can provide. Completion level is irrelevant compared to the importance of your skills being noticeable in the project, so do not panic if you run out of time. You will be able to verbally explain later what your following steps would have been if you’d have time.

* Any consideration about technical decisions or improvements about your app, please don't hesitate to write them in the README and of course, contact us (hr@carto.com) to ask any doubt.

Some hints:

* We use PostgreSQL+PostGIS as geographical database in many projects. Maybe using some previously configured docker postgis image is a good idea.

   PostGIS is an PostgreSQL extension. It provides a geometry data type and a bunch of functions to operate with (ST_AsGeoJSON, ST_Centroid, ST_X, ST_MakePoint, ST_Distance…).

* GEOJSON is a simple and fairly extended geometry representation format including features for geometry meta-information. There are tough [more advanced and complex formats](https://gisgeography.com/gis-formats/).

* You can speculate and assume any further constraint not explained in this document as while as you can sustain your assumption. P.E., you can assume that the FE can directly work with geometries in the WKB format, that users already exists in the database and thus do not need to register, etc.

* Please do not hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck. We want you to deliver as much evaluable content as possible, not to prove you can get through completely alone.
